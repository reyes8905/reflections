How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    you can see what has change in the program

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    you don't need to remember all the changes you have made, they are stored and you can access them when you want

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    cons: maybe you forget to commit something and that change will be lost
    pro:  you create a commit for every logic change 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    in case one change in one file has also affected the other ones

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log tells you all the commits that have been made, by you or other user
    git diff tells you the differences between commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    cause you can always go back to where it was working before it breaks

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    to have a more efficient way to work
